# Getting Started with Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It's a great tool for taking notes, organizing thoughts, and building a personal knowledge management system.

## Key Features

- **Backlinks**: Automatically see all the notes that link to the current note
- **Graph View**: Visualize the connections between your notes
- **Plugins**: Extend functionality with community plugins
- **Themes**: Customize the appearance to your liking

## Why Use Obsidian?

Obsidian respects your data ownership. All your notes are stored as plain text Markdown files on your local machine. You own your data forever, and they're accessible even without Obsidian.

The linking capabilities make it easy to build a network of interconnected ideas, perfect for students, researchers, writers, and knowledge workers.
